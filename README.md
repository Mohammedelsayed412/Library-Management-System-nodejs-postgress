## `How To run`
* Install dependences => `npm install `

## `How To run docker`
* In your home directory where docker-compose.yaml exists run `docker-compose up`.

## `How To Test`
* In your home directory run `npm test`.
* I add screenshot in `Docs` folder for this testcase running successfully.

## `Database`
* Database scheme pdf is in `DOCS` folder.

## `API Docs`
* All APIs are documented in postman collection in `Docs` Folder.

## `Download`
* I make download as xlsx (to use it take the route and put into browser for automatic download to be easer in test)
* And you can get it as base64 format as it is more standard when pass data to be downloaded from frontend
* `NOTE` => Make sure there are overdues or xlsx will be empty.
